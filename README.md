### What is Folkul?
- Fokul is a place where you can privately gather your thoughts - this can be small ideas to the next greatest invention. You can connect to other users and then share this idea with them - getting criticism, feedback and overall collaboration.

- Current social media platforms we have today are based around trivial concepts - from overly saturated selfies to fleeting content with no true substance. The only value this brings to the user is distraction. 

- Our goal was to not only create something useful, but a tool for people to document, refine, and share sincere ideas through a social media concept.
