        <p>
          Topics are the containers for your Thoughts. Thoughts can live within
          a topic or on their own as a Free Thought. The Dashboard view shows
          all of your personal Topics and Thoughts, as well as any content that
          has been shared by one of your Connections.

        <p>
          The title for your Thought, as well as the content can be edited and
          saved. When sharing your Thought with any of your Connections, you
          have the option to choose if they are allowed to collaborate or simply
          view. Anyone connected to the Thought has the ability to leave
          comments.

        <p>
          This is where you can add new Connections and see existing ones. Once
          a user adds someone else in the Folkul network, they are able to share
          between each other.{" "}
